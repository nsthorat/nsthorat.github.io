His background is in math and physics, and he got his masters in computer science at the MIT media lab. Plainly, he\u2019s a brilliant guy.</p> <p>We met at the PAIR team at Google. We quickly realized that we worked really well together. We didn\u2019t know why, but it just worked. We started TensorFlow.js as a hackathon project, and it exploded in popularity, we grew a team, and eventually handed it off. Soon after, we started Know Your Data, another 3 year project that went well.</p> <p>We realized that we had something really special \u2013 we could build awesome products, grow a team, grow a user-base, and successfully hand off the projects. I didn\u2019t know much about startups, but that felt like startup material to me. So we decided to jump ship and start a company!</p> <p> A selfie of the day we set up Lilac on Legal Zoom.

The mileage may differ based on your project, but here\u2019s what they were for us.</p> <p>Pre-seed:</p> <ol> <li>Have a great team</li> <li>Have a good idea, and the team should be able to build it</li> <li>The more you\u2019ve fleshed the idea out the better. Code is great, demos are great, prototypes are great. If you\u2019ve already released something with users, even better.</li> </ol> <p>That\u2019s it. They know you\u2019re going to pivot. All startups do. There might be huge pivots, or mini-pivots. Pivots are a fractal. They just want to be able to trust you\u2019ll be able to navigate those waters.</p> <p>Seed (mileage may vary):</p> <ul> <li>A healthy user base and/or a handful of users that could convert to paid customers. This is tricky, because I didn\u2019t know this at the pre-seed round. For example: if you have 5k github stars, you may be alright (don\u2019t take my word for this). If you\u2019re like us, with 600 github stars, you\u2019re going to need a few mature user relationships that are ready to start paying, and are representative of the market you are going after. If you have 3 users, and they are the only users in the world that will pay, this isn\u2019t a good sign. You need to really think this through.<ul> <li>You may be wondering \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you go get more github stars\u201d. I think this is a function of something out of control: how \u201cpopular\u201d something is is not the same as whether it can be converted to a business. Even though we had 600 stars, we still had some serious enterprise users. Some projects have 20k stars, but have no path to monetization.</li> </ul> </li> <li>This is going to be a function of interest rates! When interest rates are high, investors invest less. When they\u2019re low, money flows more. Read these two blog posts for more details.</li> </ul> <p>This isn\u2019t complicated. But don\u2019t start raising until you\u2019ve thought it through.</p> <p>Now, why do you need to know the seed round milestones right now?</p> <p>Because the goal of the pre-seed money is to get you to the next milestone. This is critical. They will ask you \u201cwhy do you need this much money\u201d and \u201cwhy this valuation\u201d and you may be thinking \u201cI have no idea\u201d (that was me).</p> <p>The way you should be thinking about this is you need enough capital to get to the seed round, but not too much capital because you\u2019re diluting your team. When you give out 10% of your company, that\u2019s 10% less for you, your hires, etc (I\u2019m not being precise here, purposefully). This is a gentle dance, and is partially guess-work. Don\u2019t worry if you haven\u2019t worked it out exactly, just think about it.</p> <p>Things to think about:</p> <ul> <li>Are you going to hire engineers? Is it just you?</li> <li>Do you need capital for other things, e.g. compute?</li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/lessons-of-a-first-time-founder/#lesson-7-valuations-are-not-important-unless-theyre-too-high","title":"Lesson 7: Valuations are not important. Unless they\u2019re too high.","text":"<p>The other piece of this is about valuation. Valuation is determined simply by looking at the equity you\u2019ve sold (e.g. 10%) and the money you\u2019ve raised from it (e.g. 100K) and dividing them (e.g. 100K/10% = 1M). Yes, this is overly simplified.</p> <p>Do valuations matter? It may feel like you should get a really high valuation because it looks and feels good. In practice, this is a bad way to think about it.</p> <p>In this equation, there are three numbers:</p> <ol> <li>The equity you\u2019ve given out</li> <li>The capital you\u2019ve raised</li> <li>The valuation, as a function of equity and capital</li> </ol> <p>At face value, you want to minimize the equity you\u2019ve given out, and maximize the capital you\u2019ve raised so you have cash to get to the next milestone.</p> <p>However, if your valuation is too high, you might have a more difficult time raising the next round. If a pre-seed company has a valuation of let\u2019s say, 15M, you\u2019re going to need some larger multiple of that for the seed round. This could be much harder, as the milestones for that may be more difficult (more customers, more paying folks, etc).</p> <p>So you want to be careful not to raise in a way that results in an unhealthy valuation as it may bite you later when you are raising at the next stage (people think in multiples of the previous valuation).</p>"},{"location":"blog/lessons-of-a-first-time-founder/#lesson-8-get-a-lawyer","title":"Lesson 8: Get a lawyer","text":"<p>Before we get into the funding, it\u2019s important that you get a lawyer.

This was really important! Don\u2019t try to half-ass it. Commit to the fundraise, it\u2019s critical to set aside time. But do it when you feel great, and your momentum is high, and you\u2019re within range of the milestone target.</p> <p>We pitched to the first investor, and days later we got the first term sheet.</p> <p>When you get your first term sheet, this is a huge moment of celebration. Congrats! Now you have some leverage \u2013 VCs don\u2019t want to miss out on a great opportunity. Other VCs wanting to invest is a great sign for them.</p> <p>I personally really dislike this. The people who believe in you first are the ones who have guts. They\u2019re the ones who get it. They get you. They get your story. I find myself biasing myself towards them. The others are just following when they smell something is up.</p> <p>Now, we can tell all the other investors there\u2019s a term sheet. And everyone all of a sudden wants to meet. This is really important. While we\u2019re not trying to \u201cshop around the value\u201d, what you\u2019re trying to do is find the right partner.</p>"},{"location":"blog/lessons-of-a-first-time-founder/#lesson-18-time-kills-deals-strike-when-the-iron-is-hot","title":"Lesson 18: Time kills deals. Strike when the iron is hot.","text":"<p>My girlfriend, who was in sales, always told me \u201ctime kills deals\u201d. Stupidly, I was like \u201cthis isn\u2019t sales, this is tech!\u201d</p> <p>Boy was I wrong. This is sales. VCs are finance people. I had no experience in sales! Across the board, I was a much worse negotiator than them. But I learned a few tricks.</p> <p>The most important one is about timing. Now that we had the first term sheet, we were getting pressure from them to sign. This makes sense. When VCs give you a term sheet, they really want you to sign it. They have metrics about how many term sheets get signed. This tells LPs which firms to invest in. They\u2019re going to pester you. They might use some negotiation tactics that seem a little scary. Stay strong. You got this.</p> <p>Practically, the way we mitigated this was to set a deadline. We chose 1 week from then and said \u201cwe are going to gather all of the term sheets on Friday, and make the decision over the weekend\u201d.</p> <p>Mini-lesson: don\u2019t choose Friday \u2013 make the deadline on a Wednesday. We were on calls all weekend.</p> <p>What we effectively did was blame a process, that we transparently communicated with everyone, on why it will take time to decide.</p> <p>This both allows you to set expectations with early term sheets, but also sets an exploding deadline. Now all of a sudden VCs are scrambling to meet with you.</p> <p>Conclusion:</p> <ul> <li>Invent deadlines.</li> <li>Make sure your deadline is in the middle of the week.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/lessons-of-a-first-time-founder/#lesson-20-vcs-can-make-time-quickly","title":"Lesson 20: VCs can make time quickly","text":"<p>At this point, we started looking at how we were treated differently this time versus last time. Previously, VCs would book meetings a week or two out. We just accepted that.</p> <p>If there\u2019s something critical, they can meet you right that day. Or at night. They will move meetings, and make time for you. They\u2019ll call you at 10PM. They\u2019ll get on a red-eye if they like you. If they\u2019re not doing that, they don\u2019t think it\u2019s mission critical.</p> <p>Huge respect for the hustle of VCs.
